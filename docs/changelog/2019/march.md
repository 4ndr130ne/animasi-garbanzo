### Custom Fields (beta)
We introduce [custom fields](/programs/custom-fields.html) to enable programs to add custom information to their reports to help them better manage and analyze their internal data by the categories that they define to be important. This feature is only available for Enterprise programs.

### Custom Fields on the API
We've also added custom fields to the API to enable you to search and filter reports by [custom field values](https://api.hackerone.com/docs/v1#custom-field-value).
