### Program Dashboard Enhancements
We released fixes and performance optimizations to ensure consistent data between the Statistics page and the Submissions and Bounty dashboard.

Team member eligibility settings allow you to configure a list of email domains that are eligible to join your program. These settings will allow or block a user when accepting an invitation, but will not affect any users that are already a member of the program.
