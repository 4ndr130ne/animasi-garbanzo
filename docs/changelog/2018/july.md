### Hacker Email Alias
All hackers now have an [email alias](/hackers/hacker-email-alias.html) that forwards emails to the email address theyâ€™ve registered with on HackerOne. This provides an easy way for programs to contact you in order to share credentials and information without having to access your actual email address.

### Sort Notifications
You can now sort notifications from oldest to newest and vice versa.

### Hacktivity Redesign
We've revamped the look of our [Hacktivity](https://hackerone.com/hacktivity) feed so that it has a sleeker design. We've also deprecated the <b>Top</b> tab on Hacktivity.

### Bug Fixes
* Hackers that have submitted a report and left the program can now revisit the report without seeing any errors.
* The reworded the notification for invites to private programs so that it's clear that it's an invitation.
