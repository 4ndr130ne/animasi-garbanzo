### Hackbot: Duplicate Detection
Hackbot is now able to detect duplicate and related reports to help programs associate and close reports more quickly.

### Self-Close Reports
We now enable hackers to self-close their own reports if they discover that it’s no longer relevant. This won’t impact their reputation.
