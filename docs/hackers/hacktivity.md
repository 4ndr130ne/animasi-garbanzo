### How is Activity Ranked on Hacktivity?
Activities on each page are ranked differently.

On the **Popular** page, vulnerabilities are ranked primarily by their aggregated upvotes. The vote is weighted slightly more if it comes from a hacker with high Signal. Additionally, each activity gets an initial boost if it is resolved and/or receives an above average bounty.

On the **New** page, activities are ordered chronologically with the latest activity being listed on top. A previously appeared vulnerability goes back to the top when there is new activity on the report.
