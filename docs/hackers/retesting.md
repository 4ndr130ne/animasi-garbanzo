As programs receive vulnerability reports and work on deploying fixes, they need proof that their vulnerabilities have actually been fixed. Asking hackers to verify whether a vulnerability has been fixed is a good way to secure the protection of data. Programs can elect to invite you and other hackers to retest your vulnerabilities to verify fixes.
