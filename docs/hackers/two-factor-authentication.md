Two-factor authentication enables you to add an extra layer of protection from getting your account compromised. You can set up two-factor authentication using any device capable of generating Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication codes (RFC-6238) to log in to your HackerOne account. You can use Google Authenticator or Duo Mobile or any other compatible application to generate the codes.

To set up two-factor authentication for your account:
1. Go your profile’s  **Settings > Authentication**.

5. Click **Turn on** to enable two-factor authentication.

9. Click **Save**.

Once your two-factor authentication is successfully enabled, you’ll be prompted to enter a 6-digit verification code from your authenticator app to log in to your HackerOne account.

You can choose to change your account recovery phone number, turn off two-factor authentication or regenerate your backup codes.
