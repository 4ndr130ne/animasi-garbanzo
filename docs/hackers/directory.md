The Directory is a community-curated resource for contacting security teams. It identifies the best way to contact an organization's security team so that all hackers can report potential vulnerabilities directly to the organizations that can resolve them. The directory is comprised of a list of various organizations that both use and don't use HackerOne. It documents the existence of an organization's vulnerability disclosure policy and any associated bug bounty programs.

As HackerOne believes that all organizations who build technology should provide a safe process for vulnerability disclosure, the HackerOne Directory aids in providing a safer internet as it provides hackers with the ability to contact an organization with their found vulnerabilities.

### Directory Services
The Directory enables Hackers to:
* Share their disclosure experiences and add security team contact information to the Directory so others can benefit from their work.
* [Search the Directory](https://hackerone.com/directory) to get the contact information for an organization's security team.
* Find programs they're interested to hack on.

*Note: If an organization hasn't published security contact information anywhere, HackerOne recommends considering assistance from the [local CERT](https://www.first.org/members/teams/).*

The Directory enables programs to:
* Publish contact information for receiving information about potential vulnerabilities in their products or online services, such as a security@ email address or a HackerOne program. See [ISO 29147](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=45170) for additional guidance or [contact HackerOne](mailto:support@hackerone.com).
* [Search the Directory](https://hackerone.com/directory) for their organization to ensure that their security team's contact information and disclosure policy is accurate. 

### What's on the Directory

Minimum Bounty | The minimum bounty that will be given for a valid vulnerability. If the field is marked with a `-` this means that there is no minimum bounty.
