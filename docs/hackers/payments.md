You can receive payments on HackerOne for finding and reporting valid vulnerabilities through:
* Bounties
* Swag
* Bonuses

### Bounties
A bounty is money you get rewarded with for reported and resolved bugs. They're used to attract the best hackers and to keep them incentivized to hack their programs. Bounties are used to encourage you to focus on particular assets by altering the reward amount for different vulernability types. You won't get rewarded for every report you send in, but only for useful, valid reports. 

After a program has decided to award you a bounty and the bounty has been awarded, you'll receive an email to claim the bounty. HackerOne will ask to collect your tax form before processing the payout. 

#### Donating Bounties to Charity
HackerOne enables you to donate your bounty directly to charity.

If you want to donate a bounty:
1. Sign in to your HackerOne account and [submit a support ticket](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). 
2. Mention the following in your request: 
   * The ID of the report you want to donate the bounty of. You can get the report ID from the URL (e.g. https://hackerone.com/reports/123, where 123 is the ID).
   * The name and website of the charity you want to donate to.
   * Whether or not you want to be named as the person donating or prefer to remain anonymous. Note that we can only attribute the donation to you if the charity allows us to put a name in.
   
Upon receiving your request, HackerOne will do a quick check to see if a donation can be made to your selected charity. If for some reason a donation can't be made, HackerOne will notify you so an alternative can be made. 

Generally, if the charity acceptions donations in USD through PayPal or Credit Card, HackerOne should be able to fulfill your request quickly. If the charity provides an electronic receipt, HackerOne will forward this to you as proof of payment. 

At this time, we can only donate bounties in full as we can't do partial or split donations. 

### Swag
Your program can elect to award you with various swag in addition to or instead of bounties. Swag includes merchandise as well as free coupons or vouchers for the services or products the program offers. Some programs also offer to host hackers near their office or cover admissions fees to conferences you're invited to attend. 

The program is responsible for fulfillment and delivery of swag to you.

### Bonuses
You can award bonuses to recognize hackers for positive actions beyond finding valid vulnerabilities. Bonuses enable hackers to have more ways to earn rewards on HackerOne and for security teams to offer more flexible incentives without increasing the market rate for bounties.
