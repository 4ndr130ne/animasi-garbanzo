When you decline an invitation to a private program or leave a private program, you'll be placed at the top of the queue for a new program invitation. 

#### How It Works
To be placed in the invitations priority queue:
1. Decline an invitation or leave a program you're currently part of. 
2. Fill out the questionnaire telling why the program wasn't a good fit. The questionnaire will immediately display on your screen after declining or leaving. 
3. You'll see a green banner on your **Pending Invitations** page letting you know that you're slotted for the next appropriate invite getting sent.

4. You'll get a fast-tracked invitation normally within 1 day.
