To get access to private programs, you must submit great vulnerability reports to participating Security@ programs and increase your Reputation. Invites to private programs are generally only sent to hackers at the top by:
* Reputation
* Signal
* Impact

When your Reputation, Signal, and Impact are high enough, you'll join the pool of hackers that receive access to private programs. Once you start receiving invitations to those programs, remember, the one universal rule is to not talk about the private programs you're a part of.
