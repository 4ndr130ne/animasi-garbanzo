The Accepted Invitations tab enables you to keep track of all of the programs that you’ve accepted an invitation to. For each program, you can view:
* The total number of reports you submitted
* The total number of valid reports you have
* The amount of bounties you earned
* The date you accepted the invitation to the program

You can also elect to leave the programs that you no longer have interest in participating in. Simply click <b>Leave Program</b> next to the program you want to leave.

### Pending Invitations

The Pending Invitations tab enables you to view all of the invitations that you haven’t accepted.

For each program you have an invite to, you can view these options:

Option | Detail
------ | -------
Invitation Expiration Time | Invitations don't last forever! They have an expiration time where you can no longer take action to accept them.
Launch Date | The date the program started to accept vulnerabilities.
Bugs resolved | The total number of vulnerabilities the program has fixed.
[Response Efficiency](/programs/response-target-indicators.html) | The percentage of reports that are responded to on time within the last 90 days.
Minimum Bounty | The minimum bounty that will be given for a valid vulnerability. If the field is marked with a `-` this means that there is no minimum bounty, or the program chose not to display this information on their metric display settings.
Average Bounty | The average bounty that will be given for a valid vulnerability. If the field is marked with a `-` this means that there is no average bounty, or the program chose not to display this information on their metric display settings.

Click <b>View Invitation</b> to review the invitation and take action to accept or reject it.
