When you reject an invitation to a private program, you'll have the option to fill out a rejection questionnaire to share your feedback with HackerOne. 

At HackerOne we believe in transparency, and in this case, it includes giving programs the reason why hackers are not interested in engaging with them. Your feedback will help programs understand why hackers don't want to participate in their programs and can better help them to modify their programs so that hackers will want to hack in them. 

### How to Fill out the Questionnaire
To access the questionnaire, decline the invitation, and the questionnaire will directly appear. 

*Note: You must fill out the questionnaire immediately. You can't save and come back to it later.

The questionnaire is completely voluntary, but if you fill it out, you'll get priority for another invitation so that you can find a program that is a better fit. 

If you've rejected an invitation to a program, you can manually be invited back into the program. [CHECK THIS INFO WITH SONYA]
