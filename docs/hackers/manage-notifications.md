To change your notification preferences for a program:
1. Click on the link below **Notifications** for that program. The link will either say *Enabled* or *Disabled* depending on your existing notification preference. 
2. A window will show where you can set your notifications. 
   If you want to disable notifications, the **Disable Notifications** screen will show where you can unsubscribe from reports.
