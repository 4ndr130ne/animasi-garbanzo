Inbox reports are marked with response SLA labels to help you monitor your program's health and to see which reports need to be taken action on. 

Each report will have an SLA state that identifies whether the report is in violation of the program's own SLA targets or HackerOne's defined SLA limits. You can see the SLA states as labels on individual reports in your inbox. SLA labels enable you to easily identify which reports are in violation of your SLAs, and they'll prompt your team to take action if individual reports are out of your SLA band.

There are 2 types of SLA labels for reports:

Label | Details
----- | -------
SLA Miss | Reports that don't meet target SLAs
SLA Fail | Reports that exceed the limit SLA

*Note: Reports that don't meet the target won't be labeled.*

You can use the default inbox filter, *SLA Violations* to view all reports you need to take action on. In this filter, failing SLAs are listed first, and missing SLAs second.
