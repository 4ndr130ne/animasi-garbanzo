The Directory is a community-curated resource for identifying the best way to contact an organization's security team to report potential vulnerabilities directly to the organizations that can resolve them. It documents the existence of an organization's vulnerability disclosure policy and any associated bug bounty programs. 

As HackerOne believes that all organizations who build technology should provide a safe process for vulnerability disclosure, the HackerOne Directory aids in providing safer internet as it provides hackers with the ability contact an organization with their found vulnerabilities. 

### Directory Services
The Directory enables Hackers to: 
* Share their disclosure experiences and add security team contact information to the Directory so others can benefit from their work.
* [Search the Directory](https://hackerone.com/directory) to get the contact information for an organizations' security team.
*Note: If an organization hasn't published security contact information anywhere, HackerOne recommends considering assistance from the [local CERT](https://www.first.org/members/teams/). 

The Directory enables programs to:
* Publish contact information for receiving information about potential vulnerabilities in your products or online services, such as a security@ email address or a HackerOne program. See [ISO 29147](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=45170) for additional guidance or [contact HackerOne](support@hackerone.com).
* [Search the Directory](https://hackerone.com/directory) for your organization to ensure that your security team's contact information and disclosure policy is accurate. 

### Correcting Information on the Directory
As the directory is community-curated, hackers who maintain sufficient reputation can update information, or you can reach a moderator at directory@hackerone.com
