You can award a hacker with various swag in addition to or instead of bounties. Limited edition swag is often well-received as well as free coupons or vouchers for the services or products your organization offers. You can also offer to host hackers near your office or cover their admission to conferences your team may be attending. 

To award a hacker with swag:
1. Go to **Settings > Program > Rewards > Swag**. 
2. Click **Turn on** to enable your program to reward hackers with swag. 
3. Go to your inbox and open the report you'd like to award swag for.
4. Expand the action picker at the bottom of the report above the comment box.
5. Select **Set award**.
6. In the next action picker, change **Award** to **Swag** in the drop-down list. 
7. *(Optional)* Add a comment about the award in the comment box.
8. Click **Set award**. 

Your program will receive the mailing address and is responsible for fulfillment and delivery to the hacker.
