Your organization’s Asset Inventory page allows you to create risk-ranked, custom categories for assets across your organization.

Clicking on a domain group opens a detailed list of all assets under that domain. From there, you can edit them individually or in bulk. Each asset listed shows information on coverage, program, owner, and open vulnerabilities.

Opening the menu for an asset gives you options to view the asset overview, add scope, remove from scope, archive, or add a tag. You can also add tags and add or remove from scope in the bulk actions menu.
