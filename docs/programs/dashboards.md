The dashboard provides information on various metrics of your program. This helps you track the progress of your program and it also gives you a detailed summary and understanding of the status of your program.  

HackerOne provides these 3 different dashboards:
* Overview
* Program Health
* [Hacker Feedback](hacker-feedback-dashboard.html)

For each dashboard, you can customize the data you see by choosing the dates you want to see the metrics for.

### Overview Dashboard
The Overview dashboard enables you to view by date and graph form:
* Report statuses
* Response and Resolution Time
* Bounty Payouts
* The percentage of the types of bugs that are closed

You can also view the breakdown of all reports by severity.
