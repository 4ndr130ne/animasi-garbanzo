With the Airtable integration, HackerOne makes it easy for you to track Airtable issues as references on the platform.

In order to configure the Airtable integration for your program, contact HackerOne with the following information:
* Your escalation URL - ie: `https://your-airtable-url.airtableblocks.com/hacker_one_report?title={{title}}&details={{details}}`
* View reference URL - ie: `https://your-airtable-url.airtableblocks.com/{{airtable_reference}}`

With all of the provided information, HackerOne will be able to set up your requested integration. You’ll get an email notification letting you know that your integration has been set up within 1-2 business days.

### How the Integration Works
After your Airtable integration has been set up:
1. Change the action picker to **Change state > Triaged** in your report.

2. Click **Escalate**.
3. You’ll be taken to your Airtable account where the report is pre-populated. Submit the issue to create the report in Airtable.
4. Copy the Airtable report issue number and paste it in the **Reference ID** field of the HackerOne report to create a direct reference link to the issue in Airtable.
