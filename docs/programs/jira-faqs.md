Question | Answer
-------- | ------
The HackerOne markdown doesn't convert correctly to Jira. How can I convert the markdown correction to Jira? | You can use a Jira optimized template by setting the escalation template to: `{{details_custom_jira}}`.
What fields are supported in the bi-directional Jira integration? | We currently support these 4 fields:<br><ul><li>Summary</li><li> Description</li><li>Project</li><li>Issue_type</li></ul>All of the fields are required to correctly set up the Jira integration.<br><br>If you have an issue template that has more required fields than these 4, you need to update or create a new template to only require the 4 fields above.</br>
I have multiple HackerOne programs. Can I integrate each of these programs to the same Jira instance? | Yes, you can integrate multiple HackerOne programs to the same Jira instance. If you're using Jira Cloud, you must first remove the "HackerOne for Jira" plugin and then follow steps 1-2 below.<br><br>To integrate Jira with multiple HackerOne programs:<ul>1. Follow all of the [Jira Server steps](jira-server-integration.html) for the first program you want to integrate.</ul><ul>2. For each subsequent program you need to add an integration for, only follow steps 12-16 in [the Jira Server article](jira-server-integration.html).<ul><li>You only need to follow steps 12-16 because the application link has already been created when integrating with your first program, and only 1 application link is needed to set up a Jira integration.</li></ul></ul>
My Jira is behind a firewall and is not externally accessible. How can I integrate with Jira? | To use the bi-directional Jira integration, you need to make sure your Jira instance is accessible from the HackerOne system. You can whitelist HackerOneâ€™s IP addresses in your firewall to only open it up to the HackerOne application. Contact your program manager to request our IP addresses to whitelist in your firewall.<br><br>If you don't want to expose your Jira to HackerOne, [contact us](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get a work-around that enables you to only escalate to Jira.  
Can I set up a one-way integration instead of a bi-directional one? | Yes! To set up a one-way integration, [contact HackerOne](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the following information: <br><ul><li>The base URI of the JIRA instance (e.g., "https://jira.company.com/")</li><li>Project ID ("pid") of the project you'd like issues to default to (usually a 5 digit int)</li><li>Issue Type ("issuetype") for the default type (usually a 1 digit int)</li><li>Any other custom tags/fields you'd like pre-populated. Options are described here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Creating+Issues+via+direct+HTML+links
