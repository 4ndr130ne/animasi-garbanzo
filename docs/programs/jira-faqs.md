What do the different variables mean? | Please refer to the [Integration variables](integration-variables.html) page to see examples and descriptions of each variable.
I have multiple HackerOne programs. Can I integrate each of these programs to the same Jira instance? | Yes, you can integrate multiple HackerOne programs to the same Jira instance. If you're using Jira Cloud, you must first remove the "HackerOne for Jira" plugin and then follow steps 1-2 below.<br><br>To integrate Jira with multiple HackerOne programs:<ul>1. Follow all of the [Jira Server steps](jira-server-integration.html) for the first program you want to integrate.</ul><ul>2. For each subsequent program you need to add an integration for, only follow steps 12-16 in [the Jira Server article](jira-server-integration.html).<ul><li>You only need to follow steps 12-16 because the application link has already been created when integrating with your first program, and only 1 application link is needed to set up a Jira integration.</li></ul></ul>
My Jira is behind a firewall and is not externally accessible. How can I integrate with Jira? | To use the bi-directional Jira integration, you need to make sure your Jira instance is accessible from the HackerOne system. You can whitelist HackerOneâ€™s IP addresses in your firewall to only open it up to the HackerOne application. Contact your program manager to request our IP addresses to whitelist in your firewall.<br><br>If you don't want to expose your Jira to HackerOne, [contact us](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get a work-around that enables you to only escalate to Jira.
I'm getting the following error when creating a Jira issue: `JIRA returned the following error: "You must specify a summary of the issue."` | This means that you didn't specify a value for the `summary` field in your Jira integration settings. Please review the field mapping in your Jira integration settings and make sure values are provided for all required fields.
I'm using a reverse proxy and can't connect to Jira. | To use the Jira integration, you need to configure Jira to allow this.
