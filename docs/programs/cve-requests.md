The CVE, short for common vulnerabilities and exposures, is a directory of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities that you can freely search, use, and incorporate into products and services.  Each vulnerability is referenced by a CVE ID to easily identify them. You can request to have CVE IDs associated with your program’s vulnerabilities, through which a CVE Assignment Authority (CNA) will then assign you a valid CVE ID and help you disclose the vulnerability.

As HackerOne is 1 of 90 CNAs empowered to assign and work with customers in assisting them to disclose vulnerabilities, you can request to have CVE IDs associated with your program’s vulnerabilities through the HackerOne platform. Upon request, HackerOne will approve and assign a CVE ID for your vulnerability and then send the ID to [MITRE](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) to publish publicly. The entire process takes about 7 business days after request.

To request a CVE ID:
1. Go to <b>Settings > Customization > Request CVE ID</b>.
2. Click <b>Request a CVE ID</b>.
3. Fill out these fields:
