Response service level agreement (SLA) times refer to how quickly your security team will respond to a found vulnerability. The quicker your response time, the healthier and more attractive your program is. 

HackerOneâ€™s response SLA features enable you to set and achieve responsiveness target times for your program. This will help you attract and maintain top hacker talent as hackers are able to quickly see if your program is fast to acknowledge, validate, and resolve submitted vulnerabilities.
