Once your program launches [publicly](/hackers/private-vs-public-programs.html), you enable the entire hacker community to submit vulnerability reports to your program.  Though publicly launching your program is a huge accomplishment, it also means that your program is more susceptible to noise from invalid or low-impact reports. Receiving such reports makes it difficult to maintain healthy programs with healthy response times as programs are spending time filtering through these low priority reports.

In order to help you and your program become more successful, HackerOne has implemented features to help you reduce noise from low-impact reports. These features include: 

Feature | Details
------- | --------
[Human-Augmented Signal](/programs/human-augmented-signal.html) | HackerOne Security Analysts will review reports that have a high chance of being invalid and will close any invalid report as <i>Not Applicable</i>.
[Triggers](/programs/triggers.html) | Set up an automated action when your program receives a report with or without a given trigger word. Triggers aid in reducing noise as they can flag certain reports.
[Signal Requirements](/programs/signal-requirements.html) | Set a minimum Signal hackers must reach in order to submit reports to your program. This ensures that only hackers with a certain skill level are able to report vulnerabilities.
[Define your Scope](/programs/defining-scope.html) | Define your scope and the assets you want hackers to hack on. This guides hackers to focus on the right targets that you’re interested in.

You’re free to implement 1 or all of these features. For the best results in reducing unwanted noise for your program, it’s good practice to set up each one.
