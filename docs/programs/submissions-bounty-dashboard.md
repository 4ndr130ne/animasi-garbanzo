The Submissions & Bounty Dashboard shows data on all report submissions broken up by different metrics. Bounty programs will show the number of valid submissions for that category on the left, with bounties paid out for that category on the right. You can export all of your data at once as a PDF or by sections as a CSV file.

### Summary
The Summary section shows a row of metric cards which provide a quick overview of your report submission metrics to see any trends. All data shown is calculated based on the anchor date selection in the filters(link). **Report submitted date** only includes data from reports submitted within the selected date range. **Report closed date** only includes data from reports closed within the selected date range. Anchor date is only applicable to report count metrics and charts; bounty related metrics and charts will not be affected.

### Weakness
The Weakness section shows how your reports are spread among the different weakness types. You can view what areas you’re receiving the most valid vulnerabilities in so that you can know which vulnerabilities your program is most susceptible to.

You can see your weakness data by number of valid reports and also by bounty amounts.
