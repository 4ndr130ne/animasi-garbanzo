### Average Metrics
HackerOne displays a program's average response efficiency metrics on the security page, to enable hackers to see how responsive your program is in:
* giving a first response
* paying out a bounty
* resolving a vulnerability

The average times are calculated on a rolling 3 month basis, and you can configure which metrics to disply in **Settings > Program > Metrics Display**. 

### Colored Indicators
A program’s current responsiveness state based on performance against SLA targets is displayed through a colored response efficiency indicator. The colored indicator appears on the program's security page and report submission page and it communicates your program's current responsiveness state based on SLA performance.   

These are the indicator types and criteria:

Indicator Type | Criteria
-------------- | ----------
Green | All reports meet SLA targets
Orange | ≥ 5 reports miss SLA targets and there are no fails
Red | ≥ 1 report fails the SLA limit
