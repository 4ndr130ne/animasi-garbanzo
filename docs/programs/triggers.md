Triggers are simple, but power tools for executing automated responses to new, incoming reports. With triggers, you can set up an automated action when your program receives a report with a given trigger word. 

To set up triggers:
1. Go to **Settings > Program > Automation > Triggers**. 
2. Click **Add new Trigger**. 
3. Define the criteria for the trigger by entering keywords and selecting which part of the report must contain or not contain certain words. All criteria must match for the trigger to execute. 
4. Select the action to perform and the common response when the trigger executes. 
5. Name your trigger and select whether it should be currently enabled or disabled.
6. Click **Save**. 

Once your trigger is set up, when new, incoming reports meet the criteria of your trigger, the apporpriate action will automatically be applied to the report. This will save you time from having to manually respond to every report that comes in.
