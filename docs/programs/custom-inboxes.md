### Custom Inboxes

*(Enterprise Only Feature)*

Every program has its own inbox that hosts vulnerability reports submitted by hackers. The reports can be accessed by the hacker who submitted the report, in certain cases the HackerOne triage team and groups who have been granted access to this inbox.

In most cases, the access to all these reports are unnecessary and it can become distracting to team members who do not need access to all reports, but still need access to some reports.

Custom inboxes help manage access to these reports. Enterprise Customers have the ability to set up specific inboxes for specific teams and can allocate reports to these inboxes for their teams to access via the program inbox.

Every Enterprise customer has access to 20 custom inboxes in the platform.
