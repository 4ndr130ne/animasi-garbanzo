(<em>~30 minutes</em>)</li>\n<li>You'll work with one of HackerOne's Solutions Architects to confirm the scope of the engagement, ensure login credentials/assets are ready for testing, and set up your pentest. HackerOne will look at all pentest applicants and form the best pentester team for your pentest based on the skills required for the specified scope. (<em>~1 week</em>)</li>\n<li>During the testing period you'll be able to view and begin remediating any found vulnerabilities immediately in the platform or via any issue tracking integrations that are set up. (<em>2 weeks</em>)</li>\n<li>After testing has been completed, the lead pentester will draft and provide a summary report of the team's findings. (<em>~1 week</em>)</li>\n<li>Once the vulnerabilities have been remediated, the pentest team will retest the vulnerabilities to make sure they’re fixed. (<em>60 days from the conclusion of testing</em>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To learn how pentests work from the hacker side, see the <a href=\"/hackers/pentest-overview.html\">Pentest Overview page for pentesters</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"managing-pentests\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#managing-pentests\" aria-label=\"managing pentests permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Managing Pentests</h3>\n<p>After you log in to HackerOne and navigate to your pentest program, you’ll be met with the <em>Pentest Dashboard</em> page where you can view all information related to your pentest.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 500px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 60%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"pentest dashboard page\"\n        title=\"pentest dashboard page\"\n        src=\"/static/b2426041c3f4f0ebc1e8f0e0c26b1bb1/41099/pentest-overview.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b2426041c3f4f0ebc1e8f0e0c26b1bb1/aa2ed/pentest-overview.jpg 125w,\n/static/b2426041c3f4f0ebc1e8f0e0c26b1bb1/0479a/pentest-overview.jpg 250w,\n/static/b2426041c3f4f0ebc1e8f0e0c26b1bb1/41099/pentest-overview.jpg 500w,\n/static/b2426041c3f4f0ebc1e8f0e0c26b1bb1/acb04/pentest-overview.jpg 750w,\n/static/b2426041c3f4f0ebc1e8f0e0c26b1bb1/a2510/pentest-overview.jpg 1000w,\n/static/b2426041c3f4f0ebc1e8f0e0c26b1bb1/6942c/pentest-overview.jpg 2864w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>The Pentest Dashboard enables you to view the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of vulnerability reports by severity and status.</li>\n<li>Members that comprise your pentest team.
