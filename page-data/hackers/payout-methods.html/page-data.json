How fast you receive your payout depends on the type of payment you're using as well as your bank. There are cases where hackers have received payments on the same day and cases where hackers have had to wait the full 10 business days. Bank transfers can be done in your own local currency. To convert bounties to your local currency, the mid-market rate is used to convert money. This saves you up to 5% compared to relying on your bank to convert the money to your local currency.</br><br>Make sure your bank isn’t on the sanctions list. Go to <a href=\"https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/\">https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/</a> to check if your bank is on the list. Banks on this list don’t qualify for bank transfers. Examples include VTB and SBERBANK.</br><br><strong>Note:</strong> $10k is the maximum amount that can be processed in 1 payment. So if you're receiving a $30k bounty, you'll receive it in 3 transactions with $10k in each transaction.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"more-info-on-bank-transfers-currencycloud\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#more-info-on-bank-transfers-currencycloud\" aria-label=\"more info on bank transfers currencycloud permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>More Info on Bank Transfers (Currencycloud)</h3>\n<p>For bank transfers, we currently support conversions to the following currencies:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Supported Currency</th>\n<th>Currency Code</th>\n<th>Supported Currency</th>\n<th>Currency Code</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Australian Dollar</td>\n<td>AUD</td>\n<td>Mexican Peso</td>\n<td>MXN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bahraini Dinar</td>\n<td>BHD</td>\n<td>New Zealand Dollar</td>\n<td>NZD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>British Pound</td>\n<td>GBP</td>\n<td>Norwegian Krone</td>\n<td>NOK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bulgarian Lev</td>\n<td>BGN</td>\n<td>Omani Rial</td>\n<td>OMR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Canadian Dollar</td>\n<td>CAD</td>\n<td>Philippine Peso</td>\n<td>PHP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chinese Yuan</td>\n<td>CNY</td>\n<td>Polish Zloty</td>\n<td>PLN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Croatian Kuna</td>\n<td>HRK</td>\n<td>Qatari Rial</td>\n<td>QAR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Czech Koruna</td>\n<td>CZK</td>\n<td>Romanian New Leu</td>\n<td>RON</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Danish Krone</td>\n<td>DKK</td>\n<td>Saudi Riyal</td>\n<td>SAR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Euro</td>\n<td>EUR</td>\n<td>Singapore Dollar</td>\n<td>SGD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hong Kong Dollar</td>\n<td>HKD</td>\n<td>South African Rand</td>\n<td>ZAR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hungarian Forint</td>\n<td>HUF</td>\n<td>Swedish Krona</td>\n<td>SEK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Indian Rupee</td>\n<td>INR</td>\n<td>Swiss Franc</td>\n<td>CHF</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Indonesian Rupiah</td>\n<td>IDR</td>\n<td>Thai Baht</td>\n<td>THB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Israeli New Sheqel</td>\n<td>ILS</td>\n<td>Turkish Lira</td>\n<td>TRY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Japanese Yen</td>\n<td>JPY</td>\n<td>Ugandan Shilling</td>\n<td>UGX</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kenyan Shilling</td>\n<td>KES</td>\n<td>United Arab Emirates Dirham</td>\n<td>AED</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kuwaiti Dinar</td>\n<td>KWD</td>\n<td>United States Dollar</td>\n<td>USD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Malaysian Ringgit</td>\n<td>MYR</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Keep in mind that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When receiving a payout through a bank transfer, the payout must meet the minimum amount for the type of payment before it can be sent:\n<ul>\n<li>Swift payment minimum: $100</li>\n<li>Local payment minimum: $50</li>\n<li>The minimum is the cumulative of all payments pending for that user.
